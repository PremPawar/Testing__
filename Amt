Unfortunately, Dialogflow ES doesn't offer a built-in feature to directly segregate performance data based on specific intents. However, you can achieve this through alternative methods:

1. Using Custom Metrics:

Create a Custom Metric: In Dialogflow ES, you can create a custom metric for each intent you want to track. This metric can be anything relevant to your specific task, like conversion rate, average turn count, or user satisfaction score.
Log Data: Within your fulfillment code for each intent, write code to log relevant data points to a database or analytics platform. This data should be tied to the specific intent being executed.
Analyze Data: Use your chosen platform to analyze the logged data for each intent. This will provide insights into the performance of each specific task.
2. Using Webhooks and External Tools:

Trigger Webhook: Configure each intent to trigger a webhook upon execution.
Record Data: Within the webhook code, record relevant data points associated with the specific intent being executed. This data can be sent to a database or analytics platform.
Analyze Data: Utilize your chosen platform to analyze the recorded data for each intent, providing performance insights for each specific task.
3. Integrating with Third-Party Tools:

Several third-party tools integrate with Dialogflow and offer advanced performance analytics, including intent-specific insights. Some popular options include:

Chatbase: Provides detailed intent-level reports, including user engagement and performance metrics.
LogRocket: Records user sessions and allows you to filter by intent, enabling you to analyze user behavior for each task.
Dashbot: Offers intent-level reports along with sentiment analysis and conversation flow visualizations.
Additional Tips:

Clearly define your success metrics: Before analyzing performance, determine what constitutes success for each specific task associated with your intents.
Segment your data: Analyze performance not just by intent but also by other relevant factors like user demographics, device type, or time of day.
Regularly monitor performance: Continuously review and analyze your data to identify areas for improvement and optimize your Dialogflow agent.
By implementing one or a combination of these approaches, you can effectively segregate Dialogflow's performance based on specific intents and gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of each task your agent performs.
